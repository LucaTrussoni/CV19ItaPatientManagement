# CV19ItaPatientManagement
A shiny app to track covid19 patient management in Italy

This is a shiny app that connects to data from Protezione Civile at https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19 and shows a "patient management" 
chart, that is an area chart showing the fraction of patients that are restricted at home ("isolamento domiciliare") or that are in 
hospital or are treated in ICU (intensive care unit, "terapia intensiva").

It is possible to select the gegraphic reference area for the chart (whole Italy or single region).
